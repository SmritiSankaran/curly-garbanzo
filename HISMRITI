print 'There once was a boy named Harry
destined to be a star
his parents were killed by Voldemort
who gave him a lightning scar

Yo, Harry! You're a wizard!

Harry goes to Hogwarts
he meets Ron and Hermione
McGonagall requires he play for Gryffindor

Draco is a Daddy's boy
Quirrell becomes unemployed
The sorcerer's stone is destroyed by Dumbledore

Ron breaks his wand
now Ginny's gone
and Harry's in Mortal danger

Tom Riddle hides
his snake inside
his ginormous secret chamber

Harry blows up Aunt Marge
The dementors come and take charge
Lupin is a wolf
The rat's a man
and now the prisoner is at large

They use time travel so they can
save the prisoner of Azkaban
who just so happens to be Harry's godfather.
I don't really get it either.

Harry gets put in the Triwizard Tournament
With dragons and mermaids
Oh no; Edward Cullen gets slayed
He's back.

Harry, Harry, it's getting scary.
Voldemort's back and you're a revolutionary Harry
Dumbledore, Dumbledore,
Why is he ignoring your constant attempts to contact him?

He is forced to leave the school
Umbridge arrives, Draco's a tool
Kids break into the Ministry
Sirius Black is dead as can be, oh

Split your soul, seven parts of a whole
they're horcruxes, it's Dumbledore's end

There once was a boy named Harry
who constantly conquered death.
But in one final duel between good and bad
He may take his final breath
